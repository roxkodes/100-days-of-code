# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2018 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Committed to #100 Days of Code, Started working on Github

**Thoughts:** I'm afraid to screw something up or delete someone's work. It is a little frustrating to learn but I've spent about half an hour on it today and will try again tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Start again here tomorrow: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

### Day 6: May 11, 2018 
##### (Wow, totally forgot to append to this)

**Today's Progress**: Over the past 10 days or so I have learned to format a lot of HTML using CSS. It has helped me with projects at work and will help me with my own website.

**Thoughts:** It can't happen fast enough. I want to learn more advanced languages so that I can become more marketable.

### Day 7: May 12, 2018 
##### (Updated above entry from day 5 to day 6)

**Today's Progress**: Things I learned today:
Creating text fields, creating forms, creating radio buttons and checkboxes, making fields required, creating a div element, nesting and what it means, giving div elements a background color, setting an ID element although I'm not sure what that is for.

I spent about half an hour on it and then another half hour trying to figure out github.

**Thoughts:** I'm not feeling well this morning but I am still doing this.

Nothing for today


### Day 8: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Creating buttons in-line styling, tyling HTML, using clockwise notation, margins and padding, overriding styles using CSS, HEX and RBG color, using ID attirbutes to style elements, making images mobile responsive, bootstrap.

Time commitment 1.5 to 2 hours today. 

**Thoughts:** I was very focused and spent more time on it today.

### Days 11: May 17, 2018 
##### (jQuery - yay!)

**Today's Progress**: I've conquered the fear from last year's jQuery failure. Last year, didn't get jQuery at all and now I'm feeling more confident... or was it Java Script? I think it was jQuery.

Time commitment 30 minutes. I have a meeting.

**Thoughts:** 
Early morning is better than later in the evening.

### Day 12: May 19, 2018 
##### (OMG)

**Today's Progress**: I've finished all of the jQuery tutorials and will now start the HFS Challenge or Holy Fucking Shit Challenge because that's how my stomach feels... like "How am I even going to do this? from scratch?!!?"

I am confident that I can do it... I just have to start and I will start tomorrow.

I spent about 3 hours today.

**Thoughts:** 
My stomach is turning at the though of starting something from scratch with just a blank black screen but I am inspired to see what I can do.

### Day 13: May 26, 2018 
##### (OMG)

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a tribute page for most of the day, I started by making one for my dad and got frustrated so I deleted everything and started over...

**Thoughts:** 
It takes time. Maybe I shouldn't delete everything next time but work with what I have
