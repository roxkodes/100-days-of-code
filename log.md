### Day 0: May 1, 2018 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Committed to #100 Days of Code, Started working on Github

**Thoughts:** I'm afraid to screw something up or delete someone's work. It is a little frustrating to learn but I've spent about half an hour on it today and will try again tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Start again here tomorrow: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
