##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Committed to #100 Days of Code, Started working on Github

**Thoughts:** I'm afraid to screw something up or delete someone's work. It is a little frustrating to learn but I've spent about half an hour on it today and will try again tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Start again here tomorrow: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

### Day 5: May 11, 2018 
##### (Wow, totally forgot to append to this)

**Today's Progress**: Over the past 10 days or so I have learned to format a lot of HTML using CSS. It has helped me with projects at work and will help me with my own website.

**Thoughts:** It can't happen fast enough. I want to learn more advanced languages so that I can become more marketable.

**Link to work:** Some of the things I've done:
